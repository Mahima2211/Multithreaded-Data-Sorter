# Multithreaded-Data-Sorter
Project that involves sorting a large amount of data in a multi-threaded environment. 




Design :

We sorted all the csv files using merge sort and used multithreaded programming to implement the same. Ultimately, as the project demands, all the sorted csv files are outputted in one huge csv file and the time complexity of multithreaded vs multiprocessing programming is compared.

Assumptions :

We assume that we have csv files with a lot of metadata and we sort all of it together.

Difficulties :

The time complexity and effeciency was the most difficult part of this assignment. We really had to aim at a code which does all the work and is the most effecient at the same time. 

Testing procedure :

We tested the code in various situations with a lot of files in one directory and a long directory chain. 

Work division :

I worked on the threading and the TID display stuff, while my partner worked on the huge output CSV file. Simultaneously, making sure that our code is as fast and effecient as it can get.
